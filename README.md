🔋 Energy Consumption Forecasting – ML Project

This project predicts future energy consumption using publicly available datasets and machine learning models developed in **Jupyter Notebook**. It helps understand usage trends, forecast demand, and support energy management decisions for better planning and sustainability.

 📌 Project Objectives
- Analyze historical energy consumption data
- Identify trends and seasonal patterns
- Build predictive models to forecast future energy usage
- Evaluate model accuracy using standard metrics
- Visualize insights to support decision-making

 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning Models:** Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- **Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE, MAE, R² Score
- **Dataset:** Publicly available online (linked below)

 📂 Dataset
The dataset from kaggle includes historical energy usage with features like:
- Timestamp (date/time)
- Energy consumption (kWh)
- Weather variables (temperature, humidity, etc.)

📈 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Load and clean public energy dataset  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Understand patterns and correlations  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Extract relevant time/date/weather features  
4. **Model Building** – Train regression models and tune parameters  
5. **Evaluation** – Compare models using RMSE, MAE, and R²  
6. **Visualization** – Plot predictions vs actual values

 ✅ Results
- Accurate energy usage forecasting using regression models
- Time-series and seasonal trend identification
- Insights for sustainable energy planning

 🚀 Future Scope
- Integrate deep learning (LSTM) for better time-series forecasting  
- Include real-time weather API data  
- Build a web app dashboard for live energy monitoring  
- Extend to specific sectors (industrial, residential)
